## 2.2.0

### New Features
- Add anti-AFK system for preventing AFK XP gain
  - This is an optional feature that detects and blocks repetitive AFK skill XP gain, encouraging active play
  - Must be manually enabled with the `anti_afk.enabled` option in the main config
  - There are 8 types of checks that can block AFK XP gain in the following skills: Farming, Foraging, Mining, Fishing, Excavation, Fighting, Archery, and Defense
  - The checks work in one of three ways: detecting identical player coordinates, facing direction (pitch/yaw), or the entity being involved
  - Checks are configured in the `anti_afk.checks` section
    - Specific checks can be toggled with the `enabled` option
    - The `min_count` option is the number of identical XP gain conditions in a row for the player to be blocked from gaining XP
    - The `max_distance` option for some checks is the threshold for which movement below that value is still considered identical
  - Logging for failing anti-AFK checks can be enabled with the `anti_afk.logging_enabled` option
    - The `log_threshold` is an expression determining the count of identical conditions required for logging an event. The min_count variable can be used in this expression to reference the min_count in the checks section for a check type.
    - Logs will be sent to any online player with the auraskills.antiafk.notify permission (op by default)
    - Logs are saved to storage can can be viewed for any player with the `/skills antiafk logs <player> [page] [perPage]` command (auraskills.command.antiafk.logs permission)
  - Important disclaimer: A player failing checks and being logged does not necessarily mean they are cheating or using a macro, as false positives can be common for legitmate players, especially if min_count is low. An example is a player using a mob farm manually can still trigger anti-AFK checks. Always check logged players manually before taking any action.
- Add entity loot for fishing loot tables
  - The new entity loot type adds the ability to catch entity with fishing
  - Defined by a loot entry with `type: entity`
  - The `entity` key defines the type of entity caught
    - Vanilla entities/mobs are defined by name (e.g. `entity: zombie`)
    - MythicMobs can be used with the `mythicmobs:` prefix (e.g. `entity: mythicmobs:SkeletonKing`)
  - The `health` key overrides the entity max health attribute
  - The `damage` key overrides the entity attack damage attribute
  - The `level` key can be used to define the AuraMobs or MythicMobs level
  - The default vertical and horizontal velocities when caught can be overridden with `velocity.horizontal` and `velocity.vertical`
  - The keys `hand`, `off_hand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, and `head` are used to define equipment on the spawned entity
    - The value is a mapping in the same item format as regular item loot (Using keys `material`, `enchantments`, etc.)
- Add boss bar animation using delay when upgrading progress
  - This allows players to visually see the change in progress when a new boss bar is shown
  - Can be toggled with the `boss_bar.animate_progress` option in the main config
- Add support for multiple commands on one loot entry
  - Use a `commands` list of strings on a command loot entry instead of `command`

### API Changes
- Relocate and create Configurate API wrapper (breaking change)
  - ConfigurationNode has been replaced with the ConfigNode wrapper class in api and api-bukkit
  - Configurate is no longer included in the api module as a dependency
  - Any plugins working with ConfigurationNode in the API will break and must be updated (such as using LootParser, creating custom source types, or ItemManager#parseItem)
  - Updating is done by simply renaming ConfigurationNode mentions to ConfigNode, as most methods are copied over exactly
  - This change was made to fix critical loading errors with plugins like Nova
- Add trait modifier methods to ItemManager
  - Deprecate addModifier, getModifiers, and removeModifier to be replaced by addStatModifier, getStatModifiers, and removeStatModifier
- Add action bar methods to SkillsUser for sending and pausing action bars

## 2.1.5

### New Features
- Add Oraxen support
  - Oraxen note blocks defined in sources will now give XP properly
  - Custom blocks can now be easily defined in sources by prefixing the `block` option of a block source with `oraxen:`
    - For example, `block: oraxen:mythril_ore` will automatically register the block state from Oraxen without needing to manually define a `state`
  - Oraxen items can be directly used in any source `menu_item` option using a string key prefixed with `oraxen:`
    - For example, `menu_item: oraxen:mythril` will use the exact item defined in Oraxen, including any NBT
    - This is defined as a string value directly on the `menu_item` key rather than the map section used for normal menu items
  - Custom loot from Oraxen blocks will drop extra items correctly with Luck traits like Mining Luck
- Add requirement.override_global option to main config
  - If true, global requirements will be ignored if item-specific requirements are defined
- Add mana.cooldown_timer_period option to main config
  - Increasing can help reduce lag caused by TimerCountdown for mana abilities
- Add sql.pool options to main config
  - The new options maximum_pool_size, minimum_idle, connection_timeout, max_lifetime, and keepalive_time are used to configure the Hikari connection pool
  - These should not be changed unless you have issues with connection stability and know what you are doing

## 2.1.0

### New Features
- Add jobs system
  - Jobs is an optional feature that allows players to select skills as jobs to earn money while gaining XP.
  - To use jobs, the jobs.enabled option must be set to true in config.yml
  - Income for all XP sources is configured under jobs.income
    - If use_xp is true, sources will give a multiple of the XP gained based on default.income_per_xp
    - If use_expression is true, sources will give XP based on the result of default.expression
      - The available variables include xp, base_xp (value without multipliers), level (skill level), power, and skill_average
    - If use_final_xp is set to false, the calculation for income_per_xp will exclude all XP multipliers
  - Job selection is configured under jobs.selection
    - Players select a skill as a job using a new item in the level progression menu of a skill (gold_ingot by default)
    - If require_selection is set to false, players will gain income for all skills and selection will be hidden
    - The default_job_limit is the maximum number of skills that can be selected as jobs at the same time
    - The limit can be changed per-player using the auraskills.jobs.limit.[number] permission node (ex: auraskills.jobs.limit.4)
    - The disable_unselected_xp option will block gaining XP in all skills that are not active jobs if set to true
  - Income can also be configured per-source inside the sources files
    - Keys can be added to both the default section or an individual source
    - The following keys can be added to a source:
      - income_per_xp - The income to give per XP gained, works the same as the value in config.yml
      - income - A fixed decimal value for the money to give
      - income_expression - An expression to calculate the income, works the same as the expression in config.yml
  - Menu files will automatically update to add the new items and components to show job selection
    - However, you must manually add a new line `- component: skill_job_active` to the lore of the skill template in menus/skills.yml under `- component: max_level`
    - Everything will still work if this line isn't manually added, players just won't see the "Active Job" displayed in the skills menu
  - New jobs commands:
    - `/skills jobs add <job> [user]` - Joins a specific job for yourself or a different player
    - `/skills jobs remove <job> [user]` - Quits a specific job for yourself or a different player
    - `/skills jobs removeall [user]` - Quits all jobs for yourself or a different player
    - When user is not specified, these commands use the auraskills.command.jobs permission (op by default)
    - To specify a different user, the sender must also have the auraskills.command.jobs.other permission (op by default)
  - New jobs PlaceholderAPI placeholders:
    - `%auraskills_jobs_list%` - Lists active jobs in a comma separated list of default skill names in all lowercase
    - `%auraskills_jobs_list_formatted%` - Lists active jobs in a comma separated list with the skill display name of the config default_language
    - `%auraskills_jobs_count%` - Gets the number of jobs the player currently has active
    - `%auraskills_jobs_limit%` - Gets the maximum number of jobs the player is allowed to have active at the same time
- Add trait commands for adding trait modifiers directly to players
  - `/skills trait add <player> <trait> <name> <value> [silent] [stack]` - Adds a trait modifier to a player with the given name
  - `/skills trait remove <player> <name> [silent]` - Removes a trait modifier from a player with the given name
  - `/skills trait list [player] [trait]` - Lists trait modifiers of a player
  - `/skills trait removeall [player] [trait] [silent]` - Removes all trait modifiers from a player
  - The functionality of these commands is almost identical to the modifier commands for stat modifiers
  - These commands use the existing auraskills.command.modifier permission
- Add item and armor trait commands for adding trait modifiers to items
  - `/skills item|armor trait add <trait> <value> [lore]` - Adds a trait modifier to the held item, with lore by default
  - `/skills item|armor trait remove <trait>` - Removes a trait modifier from the item held
  - `/skills item|armor trait list` - Lists all trait modifiers on the item held
  - `/skills item|armor trait removeall` - Removes all trait modifiers from the item held
  - Where item|armor is shown above, only item or armor should be specified, not both
  - These commands use the existing auraskills.command.item.modifier or auraskills.command.armor.modifier permissions
  - Like stat modifiers, trait modifiers use PDC and do not depend on lore to function
- Add item ignore commands to ignore interactions on specific items
  - This allows you to disable mana abilities on custom items to allow separate right-click functionality
  - `/skills item ignore add` - Adds the tag that ignores the held item from mana ability interactions
  - `/skills item ignore remove` - Removes the tag that ignores the held item from mana ability interactions
- Add format_title option to menus to allow disabling color and MiniMessage parsing of menu titles
  - To use, manually add it to the options section of a menu file (create it if it doesn't exist)
- Add PlaceholderAPI support to level up chat message
- Add `%auraskills_xp_bar_[skill]%` placeholder that gets the XP progress bar shown in the menus

### Changes

- The default contexts materials of the skill template in the level_progression menu now match the materials in the skills menu
- Add symbol placeholder support to item modifier lore message

## 2.0.9

Note: If you are using the 15 skill legacy preset and previously updated to 2.0.8, your sources files for alchemy, agility, and enchanting may have been forcefully updated to include duplicate sources due to a bug in source updating. While this update fixes the bug going forward, you may have to manually remove sources that are duplicated with healing, endurance, and forging, respectively.

### New Features
- Add menu conditions system
  - Conditions on items are used to add requirements for viewing or clicking an item
  - View conditions will hide the item if not all conditions are met
  - View conditions are added with a `view_conditions` key under an item
  - Click conditions will prevent click actions or built-in click behavior from running if not all conditions are met
  - Click conditions are added using the `on_click_conditions` key, or for a specific button trigger like `on_right_click_conditions`
  - The syntax for any condition key is a map list of conditions that all must be met. This is similar to the click actions syntax.
  - Permission condition type:
    - Permission conditions check if the player has a permission
    - Uses `type: permission` (optional due to auto type detection)
    - Must specify a `permission` key for the permission node to check
    - An optional boolean `value` can be specified (defaults to true)
  - Placeholder condition type:
    - Placeholder conditions compare two values that can contain PlaceholderAPI placeholders
    - Uses `type: placeholder` (optional due to auto type detection)
    - Must specify a `placeholder` string key as the left side value to be compared
    - Must specify a `value` string key as the right side value to be compared
    - An optional `compare` string can be specified for the type of comparison operation to perform (defaults to equals)
      - `equals` checks for numerical or string equality
      - `greater_than` checks if `placeholder` is strictly greater than `value`
      - `greater_than_or_equals` checks if `placeholder` is greater than or equal to `value`
      - `less_than` checks if `placeholder` is strictly less than `value`
      - `less_than_or_equals` checks if `placeholder` is less than or equal to `value`
    - Any `compare` other than `equals` requires both `placeholder` and `value` to be evaluated to doubles
- Add menu `on_open` and `on_close` actions for running actions when a menu is opened or closed
  - These are map lists of actions defined directly in the top-level of the menu file
  - `on_close` will run even if the player switches to a different menu immediately
- Add sound menu action
  - Plays a sound for a player
  - Uses `type: sound` (optional due to auto type detection)
  - Must specify a `sound` string key as the sound type to player. This uses the vanilla names matching the /playsound command.
  - An optional `category` string can be specified (defaults to master)
  - An optional `volume` number can be specified (defaults to 1)
  - An optional `pitch` number can be specified (defaults to 1)
- Add syntax to duplicate default menu items with placeholders
  - Creating a new item with a name in the format `item_name(1)` will replace all the display_name and lore placeholders exactly like the default `item_name`.
  - Any number can be used within the parenthesis
  - This is useful for duplicating default items across multiple slots with different materials and custom_model_data for resource packs
- Add syntax for duplicating the exact same menu item easily across multiple slots
  - Specify a list of slot values with the `pos` key instead of a single value

### Changes
- Click action types will now be automatically detected, so specifying a `type` is no longer required

### Bug Fixes

  - Each source now has a specific type and options that fully define when XP is gained. For example, all sources for breaking blocks have type block.
  - New sources can be added just like default ones, with the type options allowing much more customization and control.
  - Examples of what is possible:
    - Gaining XP when a player breaks a block matching any specific block state (allows custom blocks).
    - Gaining XP for increasing any Minecraft statistic, like the existing running and walking sources.
    - Gaining XP for consuming a specific item.
    - Gaining XP for enchanting or brewing a custom item.
    - Gaining XP for fishing up a custom item.
  - Sources are no longer tied to their default skill, they can be switched around to any skill.
- Modular skill system
  - The new skills.yml file is where individual skills are now configured.
  - Abilities and mana abilities are no longer tied to their default skill, they can be moved between skills.
  - Custom skills, stats, abilities, and mana abilities can be added using the new API.
- New abilities
  - New Farming ability: Growth Aura
    - Crops with growth stages within 30 blocks of you grow {value}% faster.
    - Unlocks at farming 5 by default.
  - New Archery ability: Retrieval
    - Arrows you miss will be instantly retrieved after 3s up to {value} blocks away.
    - Unlocks at Archery 1 by default.
  - New Fighting ability: Parry
    - Missing a sword swing within 0.25s before being hit reduces damage by {value}% and cancels knockback.
    - Unlocks at Fighting 1 by default.
- New stats
  - Crit Damage, Crit Chance, and Speed have been added as individual stats.
  - The old Crit Chance Archery ability and Crit Chance Fighting ability have been replaced with normal stat rewards, allowing a new ability to be added for each.
  - The Speed stat always shows the player's accurate speed, where 100 = 100% (normal) speed. While skills don't directly increase speed by default, you can use it in rewards or modifiers.
- Traits are a new system that makes stats more modular and configurable.
  - A trait represents a single mechanic that a stat changes/improves. For example, the Wisdom stat increases experience gain, reduces anvil costs, and increases max mana.
  - These aspects are now represented as the individual traits experience_bonus, anvil_discount, and max_mana.
  - Traits can be moved between stats.
  - Both stats and traits can be easily disabled with one option, instead of having to remove every stat reward.
  - When linking a trait to a stat, the modifier option determines how much of the trait you gain for each stat level.
  - When a trait has a modifier of 1 (meaning it's the same number of the stat), it can be displayed instead of the stat value.
  - This allows the health stat to always display the accurate HP amount you have in menus, including the default 20 HP and HP from other plugins.
- Luck Rework
  - Instead of increasing the Minecraft Luck attribute, which most players don't understand, Luck now increases the new traits Farming Luck, Foraging Luck, Mining Luck, Fishing Luck, and Excavation Luck.
  - These traits increase the chance for extra item drops of any XP source of those skills.
  - When a player's luck trait is 150 for example, they have a guaranteed +1 drop and a 50% chance for +2 drops.
  - Luck traits are also increased by the specific ability in each gathering skill, such as Bountiful Harvest.
  - The Triple Harvest Farming ability has been removed, since Bountiful Harvest just increases Farming Luck, doing the same thing.
- Mob and Farming loot tables
  - Custom loot tables can now be created for killing mobs and harvesting farming crops.
  - Create the loot/mob.yml file to add mob loot tables and specify specific mob types with the mobs pool option.
  - Any skill with block sources can now have their own custom loot tables, including farming. Create a file named after the skill, such as loot/farming.yml.

### Changes
- The plugin has been renamed from AureliumSkills to AuraSkills. This means the data folder is now plugins/AuraSkills.
  - Why? The new name is shorter, simpler, and more meaningful. The original plugin name didn't have a meaning when first made, and was pretty long to say and type.
  - For plugins that hook into AureliumSkills, the renaming means compatibility with Beta versions won't break, and a new hook system can be implemented by developers with the brand new and improved API.
  - Plugins will be able to support both Beta and 2.0 at the same time easily.
  - The new data folder allows migration to be implemented more easily, without overriding existing files. This means any problems from migration can be reverted.
  - PlaceholderAPI placeholders now use the prefix %auraskills_. Old placeholders using %aureliumskills_ will still work, but you should gradually convert your placeholders over to the new prefix.
  - All permissions have been renamed and reorganized. Old ones will not work. See the permissions list for the up-to-date list.
- Skill merging and removal
  - Because some skills were too slow to level up and had abilities that weren't very useful, some skills have been merged/removed by default. This brings the total skill count from 15 to 11.
  - The existing 15 skills can still be used by applying the legacy config preset using /skills preset load legacy.zip.
  - If you migrated from Beta, the legacy preset will be automatically applied and you will still have 15 skills. The points below will not apply.
  - Endurance has been merged into Agility.
  - Healing has been merged into Alchemy.
  - Forging has been merged into Enchanting.
  - The XP sources from the removed skills (Endurance, Healing, and Forging) have been added to the skills they merged with, so you can still gain XP in the same way.
  - The abilities deemed most useful out of the two skills have been kept, the rest have been not included in default configs.
  - No abilities have been deleted, you can still add them back in skills.yml.
  - Sorcery has been removed from defaults since it never had any abilities.
- Config format
  - The format and location of config files has signifcantly changed.
  - All keys in config.yml (Main config) now use underscores instead of hyphens.
  - Skill configuration has been moved to skills.yml.
  - Stat configuration has been moved to stats.yml.
  - Ability configuration has been moved to abilities.yml.
  - Mana ability configuration has been moved to mana_abilities.yml.
  - Sources configuration has been moved to the sources folder.
- Message format
  - Messages in the menus section, as well as skill, stat, and ability descriptions no longer contain formatting. Formatting is now fully done in the menus configuration.
  - Legacy color codes with & have been replaced with MiniMessage tags. Legacy codes will still work if you want to use them.
  - Newlines (\n) have been removed from most messages since menus will insert them automatically through lore wrapping.
  - Messages that were the same for every language have been moved to a new messages/global.yml file.
  - The messages for block and mob names have been removed, as these messages are now replaced on the client-side depending on the language the client is using.
- Menu format
  - Legacy color codes with & have been replaced with MiniMessage tags. Legacy codes will still work if you want to use them.
  - Added menu components, which are lines for certain templates that are inserted into the lore.
  - Added a formats section that defines formats for some items. Most of these were moved from the messages file.
  - Added different lore line types, with options for automatically wrapping to new lines if the current line is too long.
  - Added groups, which allow contexts to be defined by an order within an area of the menu, instead of a static position.
  - Placeholders that replace directly from the messages file are now in double curly braces like {{this}}.
  - Placeholders in single curly braces are data placeholders replaced by the plugin directly, usually numbers.
  - Context sections for templates are now under a contexts section instead of directly under the template.
  - The unlocked, locked, and in_progress templates in the level_progression menu now have their context from 1-max_level of the skill instead of 1-items_per_page.
- Default config changes
  - Added a start_level option to the main config to define what skill levels players start at by default. Players now start at skill level 0, instead of 1.
  - boss_bar.mode has been changed to single.
  - enable_roman_numerals is now false.
  - Added options to configure the critical hologram colors; the default damage_holograms.colors.critical.digits now start at white instead of gray.
  - auto_save.enabled is now true.
  - The max level of all skills is now 100 instead of 97.
  - Abilities of some skills have been changed due to the skill merging.
  - The modifier for health and hp is now 1, so the health stat matches the Minecraft HP value.
  - The health stat reward values in the rewards files have been changed to 0.4 to account for this. This means players will see +0.4 Health when leveling, which is accurate to the action bar.
  - The hearts option in the hp trait has been changed to show more visual hearts earlier to account for less overall possible HP.
  - Mana regeneration has been heavily reduced to make mana an actual relevant cost (0.1 to 0.02).
  - The modifier for Strength has been decreased from 0.5 to 0.4
  - Modifiers for some traits have been scaled differently from the existing stat modifier values.
  - Base mana regen is now 0.1 per second instead of 1.
  - Overflow mana (over max mana) is no longer allowed.
- Item NBT format
  - The way item/armor modifiers, requirements, and multipliers are stored on items has changed.
  - The new format uses the built-in PersistentDataContainer API instead of an external library dependent on NMS code.
  - Old items should be automatically converted to the new format when held.
- Damage
  - Most damage modifiers, except Strength, are now additive instead of multiplicative.
  - This means the percent increases for Crit Damage, tool master abilities, and First Strike will be added together before multiplying the damage.

### Technical Changes
- Codebase structure
  - The codebase has been split into multiple modules to allow the api to be independent from implementation.
  - The package for the plugin classes is now dev.aurelium.auraskills instead of com.archyx.aureliumskills.
- API
  - The 2.0 releases adds a brand-new API that is much more capable and extensive than before. It also supports adding custom content (skills, stats, abilities).
- The plugin is now licensed under GPL3. For one, this means that forks or modifications to the plugin that you distribute must also have their source-code available.
