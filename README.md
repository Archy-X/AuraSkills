Aurelium Skills provides a developer API to interact with the plugin.

### Maven
**Repository:**
```
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.Archy-X</groupId>
    <artifactId>AureliumSkills</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly 'com.github.Archy-X:AureliumSkills:{version}'
}
```
**Replace `{version}` with the version of the plugin you are targeting**, see [releases](https://github.com/Archy-X/AureliumSkills/releases) for the most updated list of version names.

The main class to use for the API is AureliumAPI, which has many static methods for skills, xp, stats, and mana.
There are also a few events, including ManaRegenerateEvent, SkillLevelUpEvent, XpGainEvent, PlayerLootDropEvent, and ManaAbilityActivateEvent
