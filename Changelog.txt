Version Beta 1.1.1
  Changes:
    - Remove MythicMobs support:
      - MythicMobs has removed public access to their maven repository due to abuse
      - This makes it impossible for new users/machines and JitPack to build the plugin

  Bug Fixes:
    - Fix mana ability cooldown_per_level not working
    - Fix modifier removeall ConcurrentModificationException
    - Fix missing aureliumskills.item.give permission

Version Beta 1.1.0
  New Features:
    - Add customizable rewards for leveling up skills (commands, permissions, stats, items, and money):
      - Rewards are configurable for each skill in the files in the rewards folder
      - Each rewards file name corresponds to the skill it defines rewards for (eg. farming.yml defines only Farming rewards)
      - See the example rewards file for syntax help: https://github.com/Archy-X/AureliumSkills/blob/master/src/main/resources/rewards/example_rewards.yml
      - Rewards files have two sections:
        - The 'patterns' section defines rewards that repeat multiple times
          - Each reward must have a 'pattern' section that can have a 'start', 'interval', and 'stop'
        - The 'levels' section defines rewards for individual levels
      - Each reward must define a 'type' key/value
      - Reward types:
        - command:
          - Executes a command on level up defined with 'command'
          - The 'executor' can define whether the command should be run through 'console' or by the 'player' (defaults to console)
          - Commands support {player}, {skill}, {level} placeholders and all PlaceholderAPI placeholders
          - Can optionally define a 'revert_command' and 'revert_executor' to execute when a player loses that level because of admin commands
          - Color codes will work using & unless escaped using \&
        - stat:
          - Levels up an Aurelium Skill stat (health, strength, luck, etc.) defined in the 'stat' value
          - The 'value' defines how much the stat should increase by (defaults to 1)
          - You can remove or change the default stats for each skill
        - permission:
          - Gives the player a permission (only works with LuckPerms right now) defined with 'permission'
          - Optional 'value' to specify true/false (defaults to true)
          - Permissions are automatically removed when skill levels are lost
          - Permissions are automatically added to players on join when a new permission reward is added to a level players already have unlocked
        - item:
          - Gives an item to the player defined with 'key'
          - The 'key' refers to a registered item registered using /skills item register [key]
          - The optional 'amount' defines the amount of the item to give, defaults to the amount of the originally registered item
          - If the player does not have enough inventory space to give the item, they can claim it using /skills claimitems
          - Unclaimed items are saved between restarts
        - money:
          - Gives the player money through Vault Economy
          - The 'amount' defines the amount of money to give
          - Messages are handled automatically and are compatible with legacy money rewards
      - Command, permission, and item rewards can define custom 'menu_message' and 'chat_message':
        - 'menu_message' is displayed in the level progression menu on the level the reward is unlocked at
        - 'chat_message' is displayed in chat with the other rewards when the player levels up
        - These can be either a literal string or refer to a custom message key in the messages file
        - Messages are optional and will just be an empty string if not defined
        - 'message' can be used as a shorthand instead when you want both menu and chat messages to be the same
        - Reward messages will not be displayed on new lines automatically, you must use \n if you want a new line
    - Add Lightning Blade mana ability for Fighting:
      - Increases attack speed by _% for _ seconds
      - Right click sword and attack mob to activate
    - Add item registry system:
      - Register the item in your main hand using /skills item register [key]
      - Unregister an item using /skills item unregister [key]
      - This system makes it easy to use items with complex lore and meta in item rewards
      - Registered items are stored in items.yml, this file should not be edited unless you know what you are doing
      - Registered items can be given to players using /skills item give [player] [key] (amount)

        - Use an exact source name defined in the sources section above (eg. 'dirt')
        - Use a '*' to add all the sources in the skill
        - Use a source name with an '!' in front, which removes the entry from the list (eg. '!dirt')

      - Added automatic-backups.enabled and automatic-backups.minimum-interval-hours options
    - Region storage:
      - Placed blocks are now stored on file, which means gaining xp for placed blocks after a restart is no longer possible
      - Stored in the regiondata folder organized by world and regions (32x32 chunk areas)

      - The key is the number of hearts and the value is the minecraft health that amount of hearts is unlocked at.
      - For example, if two entries are '12': 29 and '13': 37, this means the player will have 12 hearts shown on their screen when their minecraft health is from 29 (inclusive) to 37 (exclusive).
      - The values are not the HP shown on the action bar. To find the HP from the action bar the value is, multiply it by the health.hp-indicator-scaling option (default is 5).
      - This supports hearts below 10 and hearts above 20, just add entries with the key as the number of hearts.
      - The order of keys and values should be sequential, otherwise higher heart entries will override lower ones.
      - This is purely cosmetic, changing these options does not change the actual hp you have.
      - This only works if you have health.health-scaling set to true.

        - Ex: '- IRON_PICKAXE MINING:10 ENDURANCE:5' <- This would require Mining 10 and Endurance 5 to use ANY iron pickaxe

    - Added new 'strength.use-percent' option to use a percent increase damage system instead of adding:
      - This option makes the base weapon damage, enchantments, and attack cooldown more important because the percent is applied on the base vanilla damage (with enchantments).

      - Add a percent symbol in the message 'menus.stats_menu.attack_damage' for display
      - It is recommended to increase the 'strength.modifier' if this option is enabled, but do your own testing

      - For example, "aureliumskills.multiplier.50" is 50% more XP, or 1.5x
      - Multipliers can stack! The value for all multipliers is added together and applied at the same time, so a 50 and 100 multiplier together will yield 150% more XP (2.5x)
      - Multipliers are applied after abilities that increase skill XP
