      - See the example rewards file for syntax help: https://github.com/Archy-X/AureliumSkills/blob/master/src/main/resources/rewards/example_rewards.yml
      - Rewards files have two sections:
        - The 'patterns' section defines rewards that repeat multiple times
          - Each reward must have a 'pattern' section that can have a 'start', 'interval', and 'stop'
        - The 'levels' section defines rewards for individual levels
      - Each reward must define a 'type' key/value

          - The 'executor' can define whether the command should be run through 'console' or by the 'player' (defaults to console)

          - Gives the player a permission (only works with LuckPerms right now) defined with 'permission'

        - item:
          - Gives an item to the player defined with 'key'
          - The 'key' refers to a registered item registered using /skills item register [key]
          - The optional 'amount' defines the amount of the item to give, defaults to the amount of the originally registered item
          - If the player does not have enough inventory space to give the item, they can claim it using /skills claimitems
          - Unclaimed items are saved between restarts
        - money:
          - Gives the player money through Vault Economy
          - The 'amount' defines the amount of money to give
          - Messages are handled automatically and are compatible with legacy money rewards
      - Command, permission, and item rewards can define custom 'menu_message' and 'chat_message':
        - 'menu_message' is displayed in the level progression menu on the level the reward is unlocked at
        - 'chat_message' is displayed in chat with the other rewards when the player levels up
        - These can be either a literal string or refer to a custom message key in the messages file
        - Messages are optional and will just be an empty string if not defined
        - 'message' can be used as a shorthand instead when you want both menu and chat messages to be the same
        - Reward messages will not be displayed on new lines automatically, you must use \n if you want a new line

    - Add item registry system:

      - This system makes it easy to use items with complex lore and meta in item rewards
      - Registered items are stored in items.yml, this file should not be edited unless you know what you are doing

      - The key is the number of hearts and the value is the minecraft health that amount of hearts is unlocked at.
      - For example, if two entries are '12': 29 and '13': 37, this means the player will have 12 hearts shown on their screen when their minecraft health is from 29 (inclusive) to 37 (exclusive).
      - The values are not the HP shown on the action bar. To find the HP from the action bar the value is, multiply it by the health.hp-indicator-scaling option (default is 5).
      - This supports hearts below 10 and hearts above 20, just add entries with the key as the number of hearts.
      - The order of keys and values should be sequential, otherwise higher heart entries will override lower ones.
      - This is purely cosmetic, changing these options does not change the actual hp you have.

      - Stat modifiers do not persist between restarts and are not stored on file
      - Every stat modifier has a name to identify it, the stat that it applies to, and a value for the amount levels it changes
      - Stat modifiers can be interacted with directly using commands:
        - /sk modifier add [player] [stat] [name] [value] <silent> - Adds a stat modifier to a player.
        - /sk modifier remove [player] [name] <silent> - Removes a specific stat modifier for a player.

        - /sk modifier removeall [player] <stat> <silent> - Removes all stat modifiers for a player.
    - Item Modifiers:
      - Stat modifiers can also be added to items, which will only apply when the item is held in a player's hand

        - /sk item modifier remove [stat] <lore> - Removes an item stat modifier from the item held, and the lore associated with it by default.

      - Works on skulls and heads too!
      - Commands:
        - /sk armor modifier add [stat] [value] <lore> - Adds an armor stat modifier to the item held, along with lore by default.

    - Added XP multiplier permissions:
      - Use permissions to add XP multipliers for all skills!
      - Format: aureliumskills.multiplier.<mulitply_percent>
      - multiply_percent can be an integer or decimal describing by what percent XP is boosted by
      - For example, "aureliumskills.multiplier.50" is 50% more XP, or 1.5x
      - Multipliers can stack! The value for all multipliers is added together and applied at the same time, so a 50 and 100 multiplier together will yield 150% more XP (2.5x)
      - Multipliers are applied after abilities that increase skill XP
