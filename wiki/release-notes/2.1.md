# 2.1

AuraSkills 2.1 adds the jobs system, an optional feature that allows players to earn money while gaining XP. New commands have also been added to add trait modifiers to players, items, and armor.

## New features

::: warning
Jobs must be manually enabled in config.yml and requires Vault plus an economy plugin to be installed to work.
:::

* Add jobs system
  * Jobs is an optional feature that allows players to select skills as jobs to earn money while gaining XP.
  * To use jobs, the jobs.enabled option must be set to true in config.yml
  * Income for all XP sources is configured under jobs.income
    * If use\_xp is true, sources will give a multiple of the XP gained based on default.income\_per\_xp
    * If use\_expression is true, sources will give XP based on the result of default.expression
      * The available variables include xp, base\_xp (value without multipliers), level (skill level), power, and skill\_average
    * If use\_final\_xp is set to false, the calculation for income\_per\_xp will exclude all XP multipliers
  * Job selection is configured under jobs.selection
    * Players select a skill as a job using a new item in the level progression menu of a skill (gold\_ingot by default)
    * If require\_selection is set to false, players will gain income for all skills and selection will be hidden
    * The default\_job\_limit is the maximum number of skills that can be selected as jobs at the same time
    * The limit can be changed per-player using the auraskills.jobs.limit.\[number] permission node (ex: auraskills.jobs.limit.4)
    * The disable\_unselected\_xp option will block gaining XP in all skills that are not active jobs if set to true
  * Income can also be configured per-source inside the sources files
    * Keys can be added to both the default section or an individual source
    * The following keys can be added to a source:
      * income\_per\_xp - The income to give per XP gained, works the same as the value in config.yml
      * income - A fixed decimal value for the money to give
      * income\_expression - An expression to calculate the income, works the same as the expression in config.yml
  * Menu files will automatically update to add the new items and components to show job selection
    * However, you must manually add a new line `- component: skill_job_active` to the lore of the skill template in menus/skills.yml under `- component: max_level`
    * Everything will still work if this line isn't manually added, players just won't see the "Active Job" displayed in the skills menu
  * New jobs commands:
    * `/skills jobs add <job> [user]` - Joins a specific job for yourself or a different player
    * `/skills jobs remove <job> [user]` - Quits a specific job for yourself or a different player
    * `/skills jobs removeall [user]` - Quits all jobs for yourself or a different player
    * When user is not specified, these commands use the auraskills.command.jobs permission (op by default)
    * To specify a different user, the sender must also have the auraskills.command.jobs.other permission (op by default)
  * New jobs PlaceholderAPI placeholders:
    * `%auraskills_jobs_list%` - Lists active jobs in a comma separated list of default skill names in all lowercase
    * `%auraskills_jobs_list_formatted%` - Lists active jobs in a comma separated list with the skill display name of the config default\_language
    * `%auraskills_jobs_count%` - Gets the number of jobs the player currently has active
    * `%auraskills_jobs_limit%` - Gets the maximum number of jobs the player is allowed to have active at the same time
* Add trait commands for adding trait modifiers directly to players
  * `/skills trait add <player> <trait> <name> <value> [silent] [stack]` - Adds a trait modifier to a player with the given name
  * `/skills trait remove <player> <name> [silent]` - Removes a trait modifier from a player with the given name
  * `/skills trait list [player] [trait]` - Lists trait modifiers of a player
  * `/skills trait removeall [player] [trait] [silent]` - Removes all trait modifiers from a player
  * The functionality of these commands is almost identical to the modifier commands for stat modifiers
  * These commands use the existing auraskills.command.modifier permission
* Add item and armor trait commands for adding trait modifiers to items
  * `/skills item|armor trait add <trait> <value> [lore]` - Adds a trait modifier to the held item, with lore by default
  * `/skills item|armor trait remove <trait>` - Removes a trait modifier from the item held
  * `/skills item|armor trait list` - Lists all trait modifiers on the item held
  * `/skills item|armor trait removeall` - Removes all trait modifiers from the item held
  * Where item|armor is shown above, only item or armor should be specified, not both
  * These commands use the existing auraskills.command.item.modifier or auraskills.command.armor.modifier permissions
  * Like stat modifiers, trait modifiers use PDC and do not depend on lore to function
* Add item ignore commands to ignore interactions on specific items
  * This allows you to disable mana abilities on custom items to allow separate right-click functionality
  * `/skills item ignore add` - Adds the tag that ignores the held item from mana ability interactions
  * `/skills item ignore remove` - Removes the tag that ignores the held item from mana ability interactions
* Add format\_title option to menus to allow disabling color and MiniMessage parsing of menu titles
  * To use, manually add it to the options section of a menu file (create it if it doesn't exist)
* Add PlaceholderAPI support to level up chat message
* Add `%auraskills_xp_bar_[skill]%` placeholder that gets the XP progress bar shown in the menus

## Changes

* Optimize menus to significantly improve performance for idle open menus
* Change the default skills and level\_progression menu files to fully use block style YAML syntax
* The default contexts materials of the skill template in the level\_progression menu now match the materials in the skills menu
* Add symbol placeholder support to item modifier lore message
* Automatic backups will now be skipped if the server has too many users (uses new max\_users config option)
* Add ensure\_scaling\_disabled option to hp trait in stats.yml to disable health scaling if the trait is disabled (true by default)
* Update Japanese, Polish, and Chinese Simplified messages

* Fix hex colors in ability messages not working
* Fix added contexts sections breaking some level\_progression templates

* Fix Disenchanter not working when shift clicking to remove an item with a different item on the cursor
* Fix hide\_attributes flag not working in 1.20.5+

## API changes
