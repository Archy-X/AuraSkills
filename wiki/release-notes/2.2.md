# 2.2

AuraSkills 2.2 adds the anti-AFK system for detecting and stopping AFK XP gain and macros. Also added is the entity loot type for catching entities while fishing. Additionally, a breaking [API change](2.2.md#api-changes) was made.

## New features

* Add anti-AFK system for preventing AFK XP gain
  * This is an optional feature that detects and blocks repetitive AFK skill XP gain, encouraging active play
  * Must be manually enabled with the `anti_afk.enabled` option in the main config
  * There are 8 types of checks that can block AFK XP gain in the following skills: Farming, Foraging, Mining, Fishing, Excavation, Fighting, Archery, and Defense
  * The checks work in one of three ways: detecting identical player coordinates, facing direction (pitch/yaw), or the entity being involved
  * Checks are configured in the `anti_afk.checks` section
    * Specific checks can be toggled with the `enabled` option
    * The `min_count` option is the number of identical XP gain conditions in a row for the player to be blocked from gaining XP
    * The `max_distance` option for some checks is the threshold for which movement below that value is still considered identical
  * Logging for failing anti-AFK checks can be enabled with the `anti_afk.logging_enabled` option
    * The `log_threshold` is an expression determining the count of identical conditions required for logging an event. The min\_count variable can be used in this expression to reference the min\_count in the checks section for a check type.
    * Logs will be sent to any online player with the auraskills.antiafk.notify permission (op by default)
    * Logs are saved to storage can can be viewed for any player with the `/skills antiafk logs <player> [page] [perPage]` command (auraskills.command.antiafk.logs permission)
  * Important disclaimer: A player failing checks and being logged does not necessarily mean they are cheating or using a macro, as false positives can be common for legitmate players, especially if min\_count is low. An example is a player using a mob farm manually can still trigger anti-AFK checks. Always check logged players manually before taking any action.
* Add entity loot for fishing loot tables
  * The new entity loot type adds the ability to catch entity with fishing
  * Defined by a loot entry with `type: entity`
  * The `entity` key defines the type of entity caught
    * Vanilla entities/mobs are defined by name (e.g. `entity: zombie`)
    * MythicMobs can be used with the `mythicmobs:` prefix (e.g. `entity: mythicmobs:SkeletonKing`)
  * The `health` key overrides the entity max health attribute
  * The `damage` key overrides the entity attack damage attribute
  * The `level` key can be used to define the AuraMobs or MythicMobs level
  * The default vertical and horizontal velocities when caught can be overridden with `velocity.horizontal` and `velocity.vertical`
  * The keys `hand`, `off_hand`, `feet`, `legs`, `chest`, and `head` are used to define equipment on the spawned entity
    * The value is a mapping in the same item format as regular item loot (Using keys `material`, `enchantments`, etc.)
* Add boss bar animation using delay when upgrading progress
  * This allows players to visually see the change in progress when a new boss bar is shown
  * Can be toggled with the `boss_bar.animate_progress` option in the main config
* Add support for multiple commands on one loot entry
  * Use a `commands` list of strings on a command loot entry instead of `command`

## Changes

* Optimize leaderboard updating for SQL
* Optimize SQL user loading and saving
  * A user is now loaded in a single statement with subqueries
  * Saving key\_values will now utilize batched statements

## Bug fixes

* Fix disabled abilities still showing in abilities menu
* Fix level up title not working in 1.20.5+
* Fix XP Convert giving extremely high experience values
* Fix boss bar income showing for jobs enabled without economy

## API changes

* Relocate and create Configurate API wrapper (breaking change)
  * ConfigurationNode has been replaced with the ConfigNode wrapper class in api and api-bukkit
  * Configurate is no longer included in the api module as a dependency
  * Any plugins working with ConfigurationNode in the API will break and must be updated (such as using LootParser, creating custom source types, or ItemManager#parseItem)
  * Updating is done by simply renaming ConfigurationNode mentions to ConfigNode, as most methods are copied over exactly
  * This change was made to fix critical loading errors with plugins like Nova
* Add trait modifier methods to ItemManager
  * Deprecate addModifier, getModifiers, and removeModifier to be replaced by addStatModifier, getStatModifiers, and removeStatModifier
* Add action bar methods to SkillsUser for sending and pausing action bars
