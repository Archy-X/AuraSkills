# 2.3

AuraSkills 2.3 adds new customization features for the stats and requirements systems. The new stat info menu shows players exactly how stat and trait levels are calculated, while percentage-based and temporary modifiers create new ways to use stats. Block requirements add a flexible way to restrict breaking blocks based on skills.

## Breaking Changes

* The plugin now requires at least Java 21
* Drop support for Minecraft 1.18.x and 1.19.x

## New Features

* Add 1.21.5 support
* Add stat\_info menu
  * This allows players to see exactly how their stat and trait levels are calculated
  * Accessed by clicking any of the stat items (glass panes) in the stats menu (/stats)
  * The menu is tab-based and shows stat modifiers by default. Trait modifiers can be viewed by clicking on the tab buttons on the right.
  * Each tab shows any base value, value from skill rewards, and custom modifiers
* Add percentage-based stat and trait modifiers
  * Modifiers now have an operation value that defines how they are applied
  * The `add_percent` operation multiplies the stat level by 1+value/100
    * For example, a modifier with value 50 multiplies the stat by 1.5
    * The values for all `add_percent` modifiers for a stat are added together before multiplying the stat (additive multiplier)
  * The `multiply` operation directly multiplies the stat level by the value
    * For example, a modifier with value 2 doubles the stat level
    * Each `multiply` modifier is applied separately (multiplicative modifier)
  * All existing modifiers use the `add` operation, which is the basic addition to the stat level
    * All `add` modifiers are applied before any `add_percent` or `multiply` modifiers
  * The following existing commands have been modified to add an operation argument:
    * `/skills modifier add <player> <stat> <name> <value> [operation] [silent] [stack]`
    * `/skills trait add <player> <trait> <name> <value> [operation] [silent] [stack]`
    * `/skills item modifier add <player> <stat> <value> [operation] [lore]`
    * `/skills item trait add <player> <trait> <value> [operation] [lore]`
    * `/skills armor modifier add <player> <stat> <value> [operation] [lore]`
    * `/skills armor trait add <player> <trait> <value> [operation] [lore]`
    * The `operation` argument is optional and defaults to `add`
* Add temporary modifiers
  * Temporary modifiers are automatically removed after certain amount of time
  * Use the following commands to add temporary stat and trait modifiers:
    * `/skills modifier addtemp <player> <stat> <name> <value> <duration> [pauseOffline] [operation] [silent] [stack]`
    * `/skills trait addtemp <player> <trait> <name> <value> <duration> [pauseOffline] [operation] [silent] [stack]`
    * The `duration` argument is in the format `[years]y[months]mo[days]d[hours]h[minutes]m[seconds]s`
      * Examples of valid durations are `5s`, `10m`, and `4d2m1s`
    * The `pauseOffline` argument defines whether the remaining duration should stop counting down when the player is offline (defaults to false)
* Add block requirements
  * Block requirements are customizable restrictions on breaking, placing, or harvesting blocks
  * Requirements are defined in requirement.blocks.list in config.yml
  * Each element in the list can have the following keys:
    * `material` - The name of the block to add requirements for (required)
    * `allow_break` - Whether to ignore requirements on block break (defaults to false)
    * `allow_place` - Whether to ignore requirements on block place (defaults to false)
    * `allow_harvest` - Whether to ignore requirements on block harvest (defaults to false)
    * When none of the above allow options are defined, the block cannot be broken, placed, or harvested when requirements are not met
    * `requirements` - A map list of the requirement nodes for this block. Each element in the list can have the following keys:
      * `type` - The type of requirement, which can be `skill_level`, `permission`, `excluded_world`, or `stat`
      * `message` - The error message to send to the player when the requirement is not met. Supports MiniMessage and PlaceholderAPI (optional).
      * Each type has specific keys below that must be added to define type behavior. These keys are added in the same indent level as `type`.
      * The `skill_level` type requires the player to be at least a specific level in a skill. Keys:
        * `skill` - The name of the skill to add a level requirement for
        * `level` - The minimum skill level the player must be
      * The `permission` type requires the player to have a specific permission node. Keys:
        * `permission` - The permission node required
      * The `excluded_world` type defines a list of worlds that will make the requirement fail if the player is in one of them. Keys:
        * `worlds` - The list of worlds to not allow the player to be in
      * The `stat` type requires the player to be at least a specific stat level. Keys:
        * `stat` - The name of the stat to add a level requirement for
        * `value` - The minimum stat value that the player must be
  * General options related to the block requirement system are in requirement.blocks:
    * `enabled` - Whether block requirements are checked at all
    * `bypass_in_creative_mode` - Whether to ignore block requirements for players in creative mode (defaults to true)
    * `bypass_if_op` - Whether to ignore block requirements for players that are op (defaults to false)
* Add addition protections against removing items from menus
  * Enable by setting `menus.removal_protection` in config.yml to true (false by default)
* Add `speed_reduction` option to Stun ability
* Add translatable messages for command descriptions and update notification
* Add `item_model` support in menu and loot items
* Add `percent_format` and `current_xp_format` options to skills menu
* Add `xp_format` option to sources menu
* Add `format` option to stat reward to configure decimals
* Add Nexo support

## Changes

* Storing modifiers with SQL has been moved from the key\_values table to a new modifiers table
  * Existing modifiers will be migrated automatically
  * A new schema\_migrations table stores previously applied migrations
* Remove Oraxen support

## Bug Fixes

* Fix default item options like glow being saved when updating files
* Fix errors when Anvil Discount is not loaded
